# C_External_IP

## Summary
A simple program I wrote to learn how to interface with the libcurl library directly. It uses a curl instance to recieve external IP information from a dedicated wbesite and print it to the terminal.
## Compilation 
Source can be compiled using the following GCC command.
```
gcc -g src.c -o C_External_IP  -lcurl
```
